Alternative Non-Collapsable Navigation Bar
====================
The way we added it, the Navbar will collapse on smaller screens.
 Since we didn't implement a Hamburger menu,
  that means that there's no way of accessing our links on smaller screens.

You can either add such a menu on your own,
 or you replace collapse navbar-collapse  with just navbar-default
